Got it — you basically want the AGORA interface to feel like an AI-powered decision war room, where:

The conversations aren’t just shown as plain text — they are visually mapped so you can see who’s talking, who’s influencing who, and what’s being decided.

Each decision has metrics and visual context — performance indicators, resource usage, projected impacts.

There’s an archive/history view inspired by the yellow “terminal” style you pasted, where past decisions are stored in an easy-to-navigate format.

Here’s how we can structure it:

AGORA Page Redesign
1. Live Decision Map (left panel)

Replace static text feed with a conversation flow chart.

Each agent is a node (colored dot or avatar) connected by animated lines showing:

Who responded to whom (line arrows).

Resource exchanges (icons for water, energy, time, materials traveling along the line).

Hover over a line to see the exact message exchanged.

Center of the map shows the current active decision the council is voting on or debating.

2. Decision Metrics Overlay (right panel)

Every decision-in-progress gets a live metrics card:

Projected ecological impact.

Resource allocation changes.

Wellbeing index effect.

Timeline to execution.

Mini bar charts or radial gauges update in real time as the debate progresses.

3. Archive View (bottom or separate tab)

Switch to "Decision Archive" mode to see past conversations in a yellow terminal-inspired list (like your second screenshot).

Clicking an entry opens:

A replay of the debate in the flow chart format.

The final decision summary + metrics.

Which agents supported or opposed the decision.

4. Agent Detail Panels (hover or click)

Clicking an agent’s name opens a small side card with:

Domain (Energy, Agriculture, etc.).

Current resource surplus/deficit.

Decision history participation.

“Alignment meter” — how much they align with other agents in the current session.

5. Styles & Feel

Keep minimalistic, Venus Project-style aesthetics — light background, soft colors, glassy overlays.

Animated lines + resource icons for life-like flow.

Subtle AI “pulse” animations when agents speak.
