Use the exact same visual language as the Decision Archive page (same font, weights, colors, spacing, line-height, timestamp brackets, status tags, muted palette). Do not introduce new button styles, gradients, or rounded “app-y” panels.

Header

Title: AGORA CHAIN — VENUS PROJECT NETWORK

Subline: System Time: [HH:MM:SS] | Status: OPERATIONAL

Keep the search bar identical to Archive (same placeholder + icon).

Wallet connect must be a plain text link in the top-right: Connect wallet (Phantom / MetaMask) in the archive’s body color; on connect, show the short alias alpha…9d3. No colored pills.

Section A — Live Chain Events (list must look like Archive rows)

Render live events as single-line entries identical to archive logs:
[23:07] ENERGY SYSTEMS STAKING +1,250 VPC | Pool: 82,410 VPC | Efficiency: +0.7
[23:06] ECOLOGY & RESTORATION FAUCET OPENED 450 kWh → Rewilding Hub-2 | 72h | Ecological: +1.8, Equity: +0.4

Left-aligned timestamp in square brackets, agent/domain in small-caps/bold like Archive, status tag in the same muted capsule style (STAKING, UNSTAKING, FAUCET OPENED, ATTESTED, REJECTED, ROLLED BACK, CONFIRMED, PENDING).

No boxes, no shadows, no cards—just the flat list with the same baseline grid and line spacing as Archive.

New events prepend at the top with a subtle fade-in (same timing as Archive list loads).

The existing search input filters this list by agent name, status, or wallet alias; keep placeholder text identical.

Section B — Staking Protocols (cards, but styled like Archive)

Below the live list (or in a narrow right column only if Archive already has a side rail pattern), show 10 minimal “protocol cards”, one per agent/domain, styled like compact archive blocks (thin 1px border in the same gray as Archive dividers; no drop shadow; same font; tight padding).

Card header (single line):
ALPHA — Infrastructure & Habitat (use the Archive’s header weight and color)

Card body (4–6 compact lines, each a single row in the archive font):

Pool Balance: 16,666 VPC

24h Net Flow: +324 VPC

Active Stakers: 51

Field Strength Δ (7d): Ecological +1.3 | Efficiency +0.9 | Resilience +0.6

Faucet Threshold: 20,000 VPC (opens 250 kWh/24h)

Plain text link: Stake / Unstake (opens a small inline drawer with a number input + “Stake”/“Unstake” text buttons using Archive link style—no colored CTA buttons).

Repeat for all 10 domains (Alpha…Kappa). Keep every card identical in dimensions and typography to maintain Archive’s disciplined look.

If viewport is narrow, stack cards in one column; otherwise show a simple two-column grid with the same gutters as Archive uses.

Behavior & Data (no visual deviations)

When a user stakes/unstakes from a card drawer, append a new Archive-style event to the Live Chain Events list (same one-line format).

When a faucet auto-opens from a pool crossing its threshold, append a FAUCET OPENED event; when it expires or is revoked, append FAUCET CLOSED or ROLLED BACK.

All six impact metrics (Ecology, Wellbeing, Efficiency, Resilience, Equity, Innovation) must use the same numbers as the Decision Impact engine so values are consistent across pages.

Keep error/success feedback as inline text in the drawer using Archive’s muted red/green, not toasts or popups.

Strict constraints

No new colors, no rounded cards, no shadows, no large buttons.

Keep timestamps, caps, spacing, and font weights pixel-identical to the Archive list.

Wallet connect, stake, and modal/drawer interactions must use plain text links in Archive style, not modern UI components.

This page should feel like “the Archive, but live and controllable.”

Content for the 10 protocol cards (titles):

ALPHA — Infrastructure & Habitat

BETA — Energy Systems

GAMMA — Food & Agriculture

DELTA — Ecology & Restoration

EPSILON — Social & Wellbeing

ZETA — Transportation & Mobility

ETA — Health & Medical

THETA — Education & Knowledge

IOTA — Resource Management

KAPPA — Culture, Ethics & Governance

Success check

When compared side-by-side with the Archive page, typography and spacing are indistinguishable. The only differences are: a live event feed and the minimal protocol cards
