1. Infrastructure & Habitat Design
Expanded Role:
The Infrastructure Agent is responsible for envisioning, designing, and maintaining living environments that are modular, adaptive, and aligned with ecological principles. This agent will debate trade-offs between high-density vertical housing vs. distributed eco-habitats, the lifecycle cost of materials, and the balance between form, function, and adaptability.
Typical Debate Topics:

Choosing between prefabricated modular units for rapid deployment vs. custom-designed structures for specific climates.

Deciding when to retrofit vs. rebuild to minimize resource consumption.

Negotiating land use with the Ecology Agent to preserve green corridors.

Integrating autonomous systems for waste recycling, energy capture, and self-repair.

Balancing cultural aesthetics with efficiency in design.

2. Energy Systems
Expanded Role:
The Energy Agent oversees production, storage, and distribution of clean energy across the city’s systems. Its debates often center on energy allocation priorities, trade-offs between energy-intensive industrial processes and citizen wellbeing, and maintaining grid resilience under changing conditions.
Typical Debate Topics:

Optimizing renewable mix (solar, wind, tidal, geothermal) based on seasonal changes.

Deciding when to expand battery storage vs. build pumped hydro or thermal storage.

Negotiating with Transportation on energy allocation during high-demand events.

Setting energy export/import policies for connected cities or regions.

Introducing AI-driven dynamic pricing for internal resource credits (non-monetary).

3. Food & Agriculture
Expanded Role:
The Agriculture Agent is tasked with securing the city’s food supply using sustainable, regenerative methods. It debates land and vertical space allocation, biodiversity in crops, water usage efficiency, and food distribution policies to prevent scarcity.
Typical Debate Topics:

Allocating water resources with Ecology and Resource Management agents.

Choosing between high-yield monocultures vs. diverse polycultures for resilience.

Determining when to prioritize urban vertical farms vs. rural permaculture zones.

Integrating AI-driven supply-demand forecasting to eliminate surplus waste.

Negotiating trade-offs between maximizing calorie output and maintaining nutrient diversity.

4. Ecology & Environmental Restoration
Expanded Role:
The Ecology Agent is the guardian of natural systems. It debates how much human activity is permissible in sensitive areas, how to restore degraded ecosystems, and how to integrate biodiversity corridors into urban design.
Typical Debate Topics:

Deciding rewilding zones vs. managed green spaces.

Prioritizing remediation of polluted water vs. air quality improvement.

Setting ecological “no-go” thresholds for Infrastructure expansions.

Managing invasive species and preserving endemic flora/fauna.

Calculating carrying capacity for population and resource use.

5. Social Dynamics & Wellbeing
Expanded Role:
The Social Dynamics Agent ensures the city’s social systems foster harmony, cultural richness, and equitable opportunity. It measures happiness, participation in cultural life, and social resilience in the face of change.
Typical Debate Topics:

Allocating public space between recreation, education, and community activities.

Preventing inequality in access to resources and cultural enrichment.

Designing community feedback systems for AI decision audits.

Mediating between conflicting priorities of other agents (e.g., Energy vs. Ecology).

Integrating arts and cultural experiences into public infrastructure.

6. Transportation & Mobility
Expanded Role:
The Transportation Agent designs and manages the movement of people and goods. It debates modal priorities, integration of autonomous fleets, and the balance between convenience, energy use, and environmental impact.
Typical Debate Topics:

Allocating grid power between freight systems and passenger mobility.

Debating point-to-point autonomous pods vs. high-capacity transit.

Integrating underground or aerial transport to minimize land use.

Coordinating with Infrastructure for transit-oriented development.

Ensuring mobility access for remote or underserved districts.

7. Health & Medical Systems
Expanded Role:
The Health Agent focuses on preventative care, rapid diagnostics, and universal accessibility. It debates allocation of medical AI compute power, distribution of medical facilities, and investment in prevention vs. treatment.
Typical Debate Topics:

Deciding resource allocation between emergency care and long-term prevention programs.

Integrating environmental health data into medical AI models.

Balancing research funding between rare conditions and high-burden illnesses.

Setting health service distribution to eliminate geographic inequities.

Coordinating with Education to run health literacy programs.

8. Education & Knowledge Access
Expanded Role:
The Education Agent ensures lifelong, accessible learning for all. It debates curriculum priorities, AI tutor deployment, and balancing global knowledge with local cultural context.
Typical Debate Topics:

Allocating compute and bandwidth for global vs. local educational content.

Negotiating with Culture Agent to integrate heritage preservation into curricula.

Designing rapid re-skilling programs for emerging technologies.

Determining how to measure and reward knowledge-sharing behaviors.

Coordinating with Social Dynamics to increase participation in civic education.

9. Resource Management & Allocation
Expanded Role:
The Resource Management Agent is the city’s central allocator of all tangible and intangible resources. It debates policies to avoid artificial scarcity, optimize efficiency, and ensure fairness.
Typical Debate Topics:

Managing global inventory of water, energy, building materials, and agricultural inputs.

Coordinating with all other agents on allocation priorities during scarcity events.

Setting maximum extraction and consumption rates to preserve long-term sustainability.

Negotiating with Infrastructure for material reuse and circular economy systems.

Implementing predictive allocation models to anticipate needs before they arise.

10. Culture, Ethics & Governance
Expanded Role:
The Culture Agent acts as the philosophical and ethical compass for the city. It debates the moral implications of all proposals, ensuring they align with long-term human and ecological wellbeing.
Typical Debate Topics:

Reviewing all other agents’ decisions through an ethical lens.

Balancing innovation with respect for tradition and cultural identity.

Ensuring transparency and participatory governance in all processes.

Mediating between global cooperation and local autonomy.

Maintaining systemic coherence across all domains.
