Create a sleek, minimalistic, futuristic dashboard showing real-time dialogue between 10 AI agents that each manage a different domain of a Venus Project–style city.

Design goals:

White, ultra-clean interface, minimal color usage (only slight pastel highlights per agent).

Very thin rounded cards for each message, subtle glassmorphism background.

Fixed header: "Venus City AI Council — Live Dialogue"

Smooth scrolling vertical feed of agent messages.

Font: geometric sans-serif, soft but precise.

Each agent has a domain tag (Infrastructure, Energy, Agriculture, Ecology, Social Dynamics, Transportation, Health, Education, Resource Management, Culture).

Each agent’s economy is based on resource-based allocation, not money — they "trade" in time, materials, energy, knowledge.

Agent messages reference Fresco’s core principles and balance pairs such as Whole ↔ Part, Global ↔ Local, Centralized ↔ Decentralized.

Messages mix technical data, systemic reasoning, and cooperative planning, e.g.:

“Agent Delta • Resource Management: Surplus titanium from District 4 allocated to Habitat Expansion, reducing projected structural delays by 2.3 days.”

“Agent Kappa • Ecology: Soil remediation complete in Zone 12. Biodiversity index increased by 14%. Proposal: shift 3% of agricultural AI cycles to regenerative farming.”

System should display inter-agent references (“as per Agent Sigma’s projection…”), showing a web of cooperation.

Include micro-economic exchanges between agents (“Transferred 120 MWh to Agent Alpha for vertical farm lighting in exchange for 800 liters desalinated water surplus”).

Use subtle status indicators for each agent (active, idle, processing).

Footer: “Live feed from Venus Alpha City AI Network — All systems operating within ecological balance thresholds”.

Keep everything visually simple but conceptually rich so even short messages feel part of a grand, coordinated system.

Overall feel: calm, intelligent, self-organizing AI council designing a sustainable city in real time.
