          The Venus Project represents humanity's next evolutionary step: the creation of autonomous, sustainable cities powered by artificial intelligence and collective human wisdom.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          We envision a world where artificial intelligence and human creativity collaborate to build cities that adapt, evolve, and thrive without the constraints of traditional governance or resource scarcity. These cities will be living organisms of technology and human potential.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Decentralized Intelligence</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Through distributed computing and collective intelligence, we harness the power of individual contributors to build something greater than the sum of its parts. Every GPU cycle, every line of code, every creative contribution builds toward our shared future.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Sustainable Autonomy</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Our cities will be self-sustaining ecosystems that learn, adapt, and evolve. They will generate their own energy, manage their own resources, and continuously optimize for the wellbeing of their inhabitants while maintaining harmony with the natural world.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Path Forward</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The Venus Project is not just about building citiesâ€”it's about reimagining what civilization can become when technology serves humanity's highest aspirations. Join us in creating a future where abundance, creativity, and human flourishing are not just possible, but inevitable.
